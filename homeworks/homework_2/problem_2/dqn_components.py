DQN Components - Homework 2, Problem 2

This file contains the core building blocks of Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Your task is to implement each function marked with TODO.

Components to implement:
1. Replay Buffer - Store and sample experience
2. Epsilon-greedy exploration
3. TD target computation (standard and Double DQN)
4. TD loss computation
5. Target network updates (soft and hard)

Based on the original DQN paper and Double DQN:
- "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" (Mnih et al., 2013)
- "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning" (Mnih et al., 2015)
- "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning" (van Hasselt et al., 2016)
